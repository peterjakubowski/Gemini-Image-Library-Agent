# Gemini-Image-Library-Agent

This project illustrates the beginnings of a basic digital asset management system that is powered by Google's Gemini API. The system is designed to support management of photography image libraries. The project current explores importing images into a database, capturing and generating descriptive metadata, and searching the image libraryâ€“all with the help of a Gemini chat agent.
